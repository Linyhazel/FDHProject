# FDHProject - Paintings and Photos Geolocalisation

## Introduction
A method for recognising the places images represent and repositioning them on the map.

## Requirements
To run the web_app, you need to import Streamlit library: 

`<$ pip install streamlit>`

Then download the web_app file and run the .py file

`<streamlit run web_app.py>`

## Trained model
Due to the upload size limitation, we did not upload our trained model in this repository. You can download the trained model here:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wDbxPs0jIri-ea6WdRDsP2F88iPDfQ2s/view?usp=sharing

Then add it to the ‘web app/model/’ path.
