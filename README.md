# FDHProject - Paintings and Photos Geolocalisation

## Introduction
A method for recognising the places images represent and repositioning them on the map.

## Dataset
We used the python package flickrapi to crawl photos with geo-coordinates inside Venice from Flickr. However, if you just want to see the effect, you do not need to download the dataset, because we provide you with the trained model. You can find the model link below.

## Requirements
This project is based on python3.7 and above.

To run the web_app, you need to import Streamlit library: 

`<$ pip install streamlit>`

Then download the web_app file and run the .py file

`<streamlit run web_app.py>`

## Trained model
Due to the upload size limitation, we did not upload our trained model in this repository. You can download the trained model here:

Then add it to the ‘web app/model/’ path.
